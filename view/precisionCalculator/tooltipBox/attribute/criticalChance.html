<h1 class="marginLeftRight15">Critical Chance</h1>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Critical Chance is the probability that an attack will be a critical hit. This can be raised with precision, traits, skills, and weapons. The boon Fury grants a flat 20% increase to critical chance.</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Without any equipment, traits, skills, food or utility items, a character's base Critical Chance is 5% independent of level.</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">It is calculated for each hit and not each skill use. That is to say, in multi-hit skills, each hit has a separate critical hit chance.</p>
