<h1 class="marginLeftRight15">Ranger</h1>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Rangers rely on a keen eye, a steady hand, and the power of nature itself. Unparalleled archers, rangers are capable of bringing down foes from a distance with their bows. With traps, nature spirits, and a stable of loyal pets at their command, rangers can adapt to any situation.</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Rangers are flexible and durableâ€”proficient with the bow, yet surgical with the sword. Their loyal pets, which rangers tame and train, distract enemies while the rangers strike safely from a distance. As an adventurer profession, rangers wear medium armor.</p>
