<p class="marginLeftRight15">Reflect incoming damage back to its source; stacks duration.</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Retaliation is a boon that damages anyone who hits the affected target. The attacker will not be damaged if the attack fails to hit. Retaliation does not reduce or prevent damage taken. Damage dealt depends on the level and power of the retaliation's source (i.e. whoever gave retaliation to the entity being attacked). Retaliation will stack in duration up to a maximum of 5 times.</p>
