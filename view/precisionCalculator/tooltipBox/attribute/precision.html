<h1 class="marginLeftRight15">Precision</h1>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Precision is a primary character attribute. It is used to calculate the derived attribute Critical Chance, which determines the character's chance of a critical hit against targets at the same level. The real chance to land critical hits is thus determined on a per-target basis; your chance of a critical hit is higher than displayed against targets below your level, but lower against targets above your level.</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">At level 80 where the primary Precision attribute is 1000, and 21 Precision grants 1% of Critical Chance (per the table below), the formula relating Precision to Critical Chance via the Hero Panel is:</p>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Critical Chance (%) = 5 + [ (Precision - 1000) / 21 ]</p>
