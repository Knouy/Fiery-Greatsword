<h1 class="marginLeftRight15 marginTop15">Precision</h1>
<p class="marginLeftRight15">Precision is a primary character attribute. It is used to calculate the derived attribute Critical Chance, which determines the character's chance of a critical hit against targets at the same level. The real chance to land critical hits is thus determined on a per-target basis; your chance of a critical hit is higher than displayed against targets below your level, but lower against targets above your level.</p>
